Lesson 2 - Assignment 01 - Git Workflow

Problem Statement:
•	In a newly created repository, demonstrate the ability to change a file from untracked status to tracked and later unstage the file so that it becomes “untracked” again
 



comp@DESKTOP-OLRV8LH MINGW64 /f/CDACProgram/module9sdm/day2 (master)
$ vi file2.txt

comp@DESKTOP-OLRV8LH MINGW64 /f/CDACProgram/module9sdm/day2 (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        first2.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

comp@DESKTOP-OLRV8LH MINGW64 /f/CDACProgram/module9sdm/day2 (master)
$ git add *

comp@DESKTOP-OLRV8LH MINGW64 /f/CDACProgram/module9sdm/day2 (master)
$ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   first2.txt


comp@DESKTOP-OLRV8LH MINGW64 /f/CDACProgram/module9sdm/day2 (master)

•	After making a couple of commits, modify the global settings for name and email and make a couple of additional commits. View the history of the commits, which will display the old and new configurations. Later reconfigure Git to ignore files with .txt extension and add two files a.txt and b.txt into the repository

Problem Statement: 
Create a branch “featureOne” and view the commit history in this branch. Make a change to a file and merge it back into the master branch. Then, make simultaneous changes to the same file to cause conflict and do the merge again

Problem Statement: 
Push the contents of the local repository into the remote repository. Update a file in the remote repository and then pull the changes into the local repository. Subsequently modify the file locally and push the change to the remote repository
