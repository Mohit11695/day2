•	After making a couple of commits, modify the global settings for name and email and make a couple of additional commits. View the history of the commits, which will display the old and new configurations. Later reconfigure Git to ignore files with .txt extension and add two files a.txt and b.txt into the repository

Problem Statement: 
Create a branch “featureOne” and view the commit history in this branch. Make a change to a file and merge it back into the master branch. Then, make simultaneous changes to the same file to cause conflict and do the merge again
